**Problem being solved:** I tried to solve the problem development committee faced

**What the app does:**
The app that I developed allows user to create new task with, title, description, and points to the task.
When a user clicks on the task, a modal should pop up and allows the user to complete the task and the corresponding
user to get the points. The user can see the top 3 people with points in the leaderboard tab. With this app, it should
be easy to create and manage task and hopefully give more incentive to the developers with the point system.

**What I would have done given more time:**
Currently, there is no way to keep track of users and points, all the data exists in the backend. With more time
I would have liked to connect the backend to a database and also create login/signup feature for user creation and
authentication.
